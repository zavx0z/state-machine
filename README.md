# State Machine Visualization Tool

This project provides a web-based visualization tool for state machines. It allows users to create, simulate, and interact with state machines using a graphical interface. The tool is designed to help developers understand and debug complex state logic in their applications.

## Features

- Visualization: Graphically represent the states and transitions of a state machine.
- Simulation: Step through the state machine's execution to see how it responds to different events.
- Interactivity: Send events to the state machine and see the transitions in real-time.
- SCXML Support: Import state machines defined in the SCXML format.
- Developer Tools Integration: Includes a set of developer tools for additional functionality and debugging.

## Getting Started

To get started with the State Machine Visualization Tool, simply visit the hosted version at https://zavx0z.github.io/state-machine/.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the project locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/zavx0z/state-machine.git
cd state-machine
# Follow setup instructions for local development
```

## Usage

Load a State Machine: Use the state-machine element in your HTML to load an SCXML file by setting the src attribute to the path of your SCXML file.

```html
<state-machine src="path/to/your/machine.scxml"></state-machine>
```

Interact with the State Machine: Once loaded, you can interact with the state machine by sending events through the developer tools or programmatically using the provided API.

Visualize Transitions: As you interact with the state machine, the visualization will update to reflect the current state and transitions.

## Development

For local development, you may need to install dependencies and build the project. Please refer to the package.json for scripts that can help with the development process.
